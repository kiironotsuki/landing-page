# Landing Page Project

This is a landing page project created as part of the [Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/foundations) course by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). The objective of this project is to practice and demonstrate the foundational skills of HTML and CSS by building a simple landing page.

## Project Overview

The landing page consists of a single HTML file (`index.html`) and a CSS file (`styles.css`). The HTML file contains the structure and content of the landing page, while the CSS file is responsible for the styling and layout of the page.

## Getting Started

To view the landing page, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

Alternatively, you can access the live version of the landing page by visiting the following URL: [https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page)

## Project Structure

The project files and directories are organized as follows:

```
├── index.html
└── css
    └── styles.css
```

- `index.html`: This file contains the HTML structure and content of the landing page.
- `css/styles.css`: This file contains the CSS rules and styles for the landing page.
